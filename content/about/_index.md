Hi, I'm Matteo, a 19 year old student from Germany.

I am interested in programming, compilers, tech and hardware. In my free time I
like to contribute to free and open source software, as well as writing my own
quality of life improving projects.

I am currently majoring in applied computer science at [DHBW](https://www.dhbw.de/startseite).
