My blog / portfolio is now officially a [512kb club](https://512kb.club) green team member. 

![512kb-club-badge](https://512kb.club/assets/images/green-team.svg)

I dislike the badge and will add a better locking one once I find one.

I really really like the idea behind yesterweb and the 512kb club and promptly added some badges to my [~/about](/about):

| Badge | Description |
| :---: | :---------: |
|![](/images/badges/nothingtoblock.gif) | A badge to show i do not use any analytics or malicious scripts on this page and therefore have nothing the users needs to block. |
