> Since I'm working 1/2 of the year due to the dual study model[^DE], I will showcase both a day at university and a day at work. 

## Typical Wednesday at the university

### 7:30 Waking up 
Eating cornflakes with milk and drinking a cacao.
### 8:45 Walking to the campus
Since I'm fairly close to the campus (640m) I walk around 7-10min to the classroom.

This Wednesday we took **Formal languages and finite automata** and had a lot of theoretical input about automata and graph theory.
