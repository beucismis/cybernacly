Yesterday I received an email from a CEO of a firm which prides itself for being *an end-to-end, secure backend server for mobile and web developers*.

It was addressed to an email address associated with my Github account, which i used in old commits (*before i knew about the hide my email setting*).

According to Mr. Spataro, he became aware of my account while looking through the Bootstrap stargazer, despite me not giving the Bootstrap project a star.

Not only that, but the lack of personalized salutation indicate that this email was sent automatically.

I would not be surprised if commits are searched categorically to spam the linked email addresses.

Here is his email to whose audacity I then promptly replied:

**The email also contained a lot of tracking url params in its links, and a pixel tracker itself**

I find it sad, but of course predictable, that now advertisements are also sent to automatically collected email addresses used in Github commits.
