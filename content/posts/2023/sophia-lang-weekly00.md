{{<callout type="Tip">}}
This series will be a continuous somewhat weekly newsletter about my progress,
changes and anything around the [sophia](https://github.com/xnacly/sophia)
programming language. I will try to publish one post of the series containing
the changes and ideas for every week I have time to work on the project, so
expect around 2-3 a month, mostly on Sundays. These posts will be short,
concise. Basic knowledge of interpreter and programming language
design is assumed.
{{</callout>}}

This weeks changes include improvements to the performance of certain
benchmarks, clearer errors for illegal index operations, reworked index syntax
for arrays and objects (with shortcomings) and a big planned feature.

## Performance improvements

## Reworked array and object index notation

## More precise illegal index error feedback

## Planned feature: modules

> or how I no longer consider object attached functions a good idea
