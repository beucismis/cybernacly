First of all, merry christmas, second of all - This week I rewrote the array
and object index syntax, again (yes again). I also improved (I think) the way
functions and loops are defined. I introduced three new built-in functions and
added a license.

### Reworked array and object index notation (V3)

### New function and loop creation syntax

### More built-in functions

#### Map

#### Filter

#### Assert

### Finally, a License

### Thinking about lambdas
